    <h1>CLARIFIED BUTTER</h1>
    <p>Our decadent English muffins are cooked in butter, a great cooking medium with one major drawback—the milk solids in butter burn easily. Clarifying the butter is an easy process that removes the milk solids. Leftover clarified butter can be used like oil for sautéing food. It keeps for a few weeks in a refrigerated covered container.</p>
