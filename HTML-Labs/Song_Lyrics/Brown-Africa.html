<h1>Africa by Toto</h1>
<hr>
<p>
Hear the drums echoing tonight<br>
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation<br>
She's comin' in, 12:30 flight<br>
Her moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
</p>
<p>
I stopped an old man along the way<br>
Hopin' to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies<br>
He turned to me as if to say<br>
<em>"Hurry, boy, it's waiting there for you"</em>
</p>
<p><strong>
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you<br>
There's nothin' that a hundred men or more could ever do<br>
I bless the rains down in Africa<br>
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had, ooh-hoo
</strong></p>
<p>
The wild dogs cry out in the night<br>
As they grow restless longing for some solitary company<br>
I know that I must do what's right<br>
Sure as <a href="https://www.climbing-kilimanjaro.com"><i>Kilimanjaro</i></a> rises like <i>Olympus</i> 
above the <a href="https://www.serengeti.com"><i>Serengeti</i></a><br>
I seek to cure what's deep inside<br>
Frightened of this thing that I've become
</p>
<p><strong>
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you<br>
There's nothin' that a hundred men or more could ever do<br>
I bless the rains down in Africa<br>
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had, ooh-hoo
</strong></p>
<p>
<em>Hurry, boy, she's waiting there for you</em>
</p>
<p><strong>
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you<br>
There's nothin' that a hundred men or more could ever do<br>
I bless the rains down in Africa<br>
I bless the rains down in Africa (I bless the rains)
</strong></p>
<p>
I bless the rains down in Africa (I bless the rains)<br>
I bless the rains down in Africa<br>
I bless the rains down in Africa (ooh, I'm gonna take the time)<br>
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had, ooh-hoo
