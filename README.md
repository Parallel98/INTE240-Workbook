# INTE240_Rocks
You’ve just stepped into my little corner of the internet, where all the magic from my INTE240 class happens. Think of this place like a cozy room, filled with all the assignments, projects, and labs I’ve worked on. It’s a space where ideas come to life, and the journey is as important as the destination.

I've got the coffee brewing so grab a comfy chair, kick back, and explore my work. Whether you’re here to browse or just want a peek into my process, feel free to settle in. I’ve got everything neatly organized, with a touch of personality to make it feel like home. Please stay as long as you like.
